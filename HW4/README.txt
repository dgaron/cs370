1. Is the Shortest Remaining Time First a non-preemptive Algorithm?

Shortest remaining time first is a pre-emptive version of shortest-job first.

2. What are the 5 different states a process can be in scheduling (Look into process state
diagram)?

New, ready, running, waiting, terminated 

3. Shortest Job First is like Priority Scheduling with the priority based on ______ of the process?

burst time

4. ________ effect is the primary disadvantage of First Come First Serve Scheduling algorithm.

The convoy effect

5. How does Multi Level Feedback queue prevent starvation of processes that waits too long in
lower priority queue?

Multi-level feedback queues use "aging" to increase the priority of processes the longer they wait. Processes can move between queues.
